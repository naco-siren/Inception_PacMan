# Inception: Pac-Man

## Intro
*Inception: Pac-Man* is a Virtual Reality action game saluting the movie *Inception* and the game *Pac-Man*. 

It stands out among 51 competitors as one of the best three projects and will be continued as a future project in later semesters for the course [*CS498SL: Virtual Reality*](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498sl3/gallery.php) at UIUC.

### Game Control
* Absolute direction Joystick controller instead of a camera relative one, loyal to the original *Pac-Man*'s game control experience. 
* The camera adopts a third-person perspective, smoothly following Pac-Mac, the gamer's avatar.
* Game objects between the avatar and camera automatically turn semi-transparent in order to not block the view.
* Functions of game pausing, time countdown, remaining lives, highscore records, etc.

### Design
* Reincarnates the classic design of Pac-Dots and Power-Pellets: Gamer will win huge bonus if the Pac-Man catches a ghost within the time limit of the Power-Pellet.
* The map of Level 1 is based on UIUC campus, and Siebel Center owns a special Power-Pellet!
* Pac-Man can "walk onto" neighbouring perpendicular "horizons".
* Ghosts' AI is able to envelope Pac-Man from different routes!
